### 💻 Project info

Forty Winks is a full-stack app designed to provide a relaxing ambience to help users sleep peacefully. 

Stop counting sheep, get Forty Winks!

🎯 Our main goal was to develop a robust full-stack application within a tight deadline of less than 3 weeks. Throughout the project, we applied the skills and knowledge acquired during the intensive 15-week Sky Get Into Tech course and we are excited to showcase the final product.

### 🔄 Our Process

Note: The provided diagrams represent the initial design and may not reflect the final implementation.

The project started with defining the requirements of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and refining them to ensure an achievable goal.

We successfully implemented the MVP, along with additional extensions, including a hidden admin login section.

The Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram represents the database structure and entity relationships, facilitating the implementation of essential functionalities for Forty Winks.

### 💡 Main Features
- MVP: Landing + Media + Tips + Contact page
- Extras: After completing the MVP, we focused on developing extra features, including:
  - Email: When a user completes the contact form, we implemented the functionality for our website to send an email to Forty Winks Gmail.
  - Admin section: This is a hidden website accessible only to admins of Forty Winks. Admins can log in and manage the database behind the Media functionality. In this section, admins can perform full CRUD functionality—they can Add, View, Update and Delete media items.
- Formatting: We utilised Bootstrap for various components such as carousels, featurettes, accordions, forms and navigation bar. Additionally, Google Fonts and icon buttons were incorporated.
- Responsive website: The website is designed to be responsive and can be accessed and used on various devices, including computers, tablets, and mobiles.
