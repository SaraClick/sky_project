        <h3 class="article_heading">Why Sleep Is Essential For Health</h3>
            <p>Getting enough sleep is essential for maintaining optimal health and well-being. Like exercise and a balanced diet, sleep may help prevent a range of health issues, including heart disease and depression.</p> 
        
            <p>Modern-day living in the United States and many other countries does not always embrace the necessity for adequate sleep. Yet, it is important that people make an effort to get enough sleep regularly.The following are some of the many benefits health professionals associate with getting a good night’s rest.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Better memmory & performace</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449130"> A 2017</a> studyTrusted Source looked into the short and long-term health consequences of sleep disruption.</a></p>

            <p>Researchers noted that sleep has links to several brain functions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Sleep disruption may affect memory processing and formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> People’s performance at work, school, and other settings is affected by sleep disruption. This includes focus, emotional reactivity, decision-making, risk-taking behavior, and judgment.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognition:</strong> By affecting stress hormones, sleep disruption may affect cognition.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>A 2015 study in the <hl-trusted-source><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25052368/">Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</a></hl-trusted-source>showed that children’s sleep patterns could directly impact their behavior and academic performance.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Lower weight gain risk</h3>
            <p>The link between weight gain and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323446">obesity</a> and short sleep patterns is unclear.</p>

            <p>There have been several studies throughout the years that have linked obesity and poor sleep patterns.</p>
            
            <p> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196958/">A 2018</a>  studyTrusted Source suggests that people who regularly sleep less than seven hours a night are more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI) and develop obesity than those who sleep more.</p>
            
            <p>Researchers suggested sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of gherlin (the hunger hormone), salt retention and inflammatory markers. They also noted that decreased sleep results in increased fatigue, which may affect a person’s desire or ability to exercise and maintain a healthful lifestyle.</p>
            
            <p>More research is needed to better understand the links between poor sleep and weight gain.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Better calorie regulation</h3>
            <p>Similarly to gaining weight, there is evidence to suggest that getting a good night’s sleep can help a person’s body take in fewer calories.</p>

            <p>For example, a 2022 clinical trial found that overweight adults who increased their sleep duration took in fewer calories compared with a control group.</p>
            
            </p>The adults increased their sleep by 1.2 hours on average, and took in around 270 calories fewer than the control group. The researchers suggested that improving and maintaining healthy sleep duration could help with weight loss and obesity prevention.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Greater athletic performance</h3>
            </p>Adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a night, but recent studies have suggested that athletes may need more.</p>

            </p>Sleep is important for athletes and people participating in sport because the body heals during sleep. Other benefits include:</p>
        
        <div>
         <ul class="art1">
           <li class="art_list">better endurance</li>
           <li class="art_list">more energy</li>
           <li class="art_list">better accuracy and reaction time</ul>
           <li class="art_list">faster speed</li>
           <li class="art_list">better mental functioning</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Lower risk of heart disease</h3>
          <p>One risk factor for heart disease is high blood pressure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, getting adequate rest each night allows the body’s blood pressure to regulate itself.</p>

          <p>Getting a good night’s sleep can also reduce the chances of sleep-related conditions such as apnea and promote better overall heart health.</p>
